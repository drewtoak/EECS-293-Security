EECS 293
Author: Andrew Hwang

Input:
The program blacklists the hosts that generated an excessive 
number of failed logins or illegal user attempts. Its command 
line argument is a security threshold, by default equal to 
three. It takes from standard input the full log summary 
(including but not limited to the failed login and illegal 
user sections).

Output: Deny List
The program will generate on standard output a list of hosts 
to be blacklisted. The output only lists the hosts who made 
a combined total of failed logins or illegal user attempts 
more than the threshold. It uses the fully qualified domain 
names when available and lists the IP addresses otherwise. 
It does not list the same host more than once. The output 
consists of a sequence of lines with five leading blanks, 
all but the last one terminated by a backslash. Each line is
a comma-separated list of offending hosts. No line contains 
more than eighty characters. The only exception would be a 
long host name that would not fit in an eighty-character line.
